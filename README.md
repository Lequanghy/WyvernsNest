A 2D turn-based fantasy strategy game

***

## Project setup

Make sure Visual Studio is installed first.

Clone the repository onto your machine.

Download [this zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hAXUjqF0_p8v5UdK9ET0I-kugZknO9Fi/view?usp=sharing) and extract the lib folder into the same directory as your solution (*The libs folder should be at the same level as the .sln file*)

Finally, move the two **dll** files from the libs folder into the root folder. (*The root folder should contain the .sln file, the libs folder, SDL2.dll and glew32.dll*)

You should be able to build and run the project now.
